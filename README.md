### Exercise Optimalness

My senior comp tool is diving into the successfulness or in gym terms the optimalness of one's workout. This tool which
as of right now I am using the HealthFit app to take in biometrics from my personal workouts to generate a LLM response
to tell the user if the workout was successful and why. The motivation for my project is I love working out in the gym and
there's lots of tools that give the biometrics but from my knowledge nothing that gives a summary based on research and science
of if the workout was optimal and successful for you. My idea of an end goal is that the tool and read biometrics within a Google
spreadsheet or CSV file and based on results and past workouts I provide, give a result to the user saying how the workout went..
